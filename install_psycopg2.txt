  Error: pg_config executable not found.
  
  pg_config is required to build psycopg2 from source.  Please add the directory
  containing pg_config to the $PATH or specify the full executable path with the
  option:
  
      python setup.py build_ext --pg-config /path/to/pg_config build ...
  
  or with the pg_config option in 'setup.cfg'.
  
  If you prefer to avoid building psycopg2 from source, please install the PyPI
  'psycopg2-binary' package instead.
  
  For further information please check the 'doc/src/install.rst' file (also at
  <https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html>).
